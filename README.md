# vocabulary-quiz

I developed vocabulary quiz app in JavaScript including creating technical requirements, implementing logic and functionality, and styling the app.

## App Development Plan

1.showing one question on the screen
2.enable user input and answering logic
3.improve the structure of the app
4.extend app to handle multiple questions
5.add score and user feedback to the app
6.add CSS style to enhance app looking

To do this, I will represent the question in a JavaScript variable, then display the question in HTML
